<H1>Zooming and Viewing</H1>

<P>To make it simple, all the navigation operations are placed on the Wheel button of your mouse. The left button is reserved for the selection (see the <A HREF="Navigation_Selecting_Parts.htm">Selecting Parts</A> section), and the right button is mainly for the context menus.</P>

<H2>Zooming</H2>
<P>Zooming can be done using the <span class="Important">mouse wheel</span> or by holding down the SHIFT + RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON while moving the mouse up or down. You can configure the Zooming behavior (zooming speed, zoom center) in the <A HREF="Preferences_Edition.htm">Edition Preferences</A>.</P>

<H2>Paning the view</H2>
<P>The Viewing position can be changed by <span class="Important">holding down the mouse wheel</span> over the Layout and moving the mouse as required. Alternatively you can hold the SHIFT + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON buttons down and move the mouse as required.</P>

<p>Currently BlueBrick does not provide slide bars on the layout pane to pane the view, but this feature may be added one day in a future release.</p>
