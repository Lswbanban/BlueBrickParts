<P><B>Adding Shortcut Keys</B> can be done using the four drop down menus at the bottom of the Shortcut list. Choose each the Key on you keyboard to which you would like to assign the function <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">1</FONT>, then which function this key is supposed to perform <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">2</FONT>, the part or set number which it will use <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">3</FONT>, and the connection type it will have <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">4</FONT>. To complete the addition Press the "Add Shortcut" button <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">5</FONT>. </P>

<P>Note that a short cut can not be edited once it has been created. You must delete the shortcut you want to change, and create a new one. Pressing the "Restore Default" button <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">6</FONT>, will delete any custom shortcuts you have made. Note that the Restore Default button <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">6</FONT>, resets the settings on all four tabs at the same time. It does not only reset the settings on the tab which you are currently viewing.</P>

<P>These changes will be permanent once you press the "OK" button. If you press "Cancel" the changes will be discarded.</P>
