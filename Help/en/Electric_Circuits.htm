<P>The <B>Electric Circuits</B> option, which can be found in the "View" menu, makes it possible to check for short circuits within a layout.</P>

<P>This feature is specifically aimed at users of 12 and 9 volt track. When using 12 or 9 volt track, any configuration that permits a train to reverse direction (such as a wye or reversing loop), will create a short circuit. When activated, this feature will mark the section of track which is causing the short circuit with an orange "Z".</P>

<P>Short circuits are no longer an issue when using RC and Power Function track as these do not have integrated powerlines.</P>
