<P>The <B>Search and Replace</B> function can be found in the "Edit" menu.</P>

<P>The <B>Search</B> component can be used to find all parts of your choice within the layers you select. To do this, simply select the part from the top dropdown list, chose the layers you want to search in and press "select all".</P>

<P>The <B>Replace</B> component is very useful if you want to change a selection of parts, or all parts of a specific type within certain layers, to something else. Good examples are the changing of 9V track to 12V track, or if you want to change the type/version of a specific roadplate which you have used within your layout.</P>
