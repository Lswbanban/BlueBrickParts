<P><B>Flex Track</B> is put together in the same way as other types of lego track. The main difference is how the track can be "flexed" into shape after several individual pieces have been connected.</P>

<P>To flex a section of Flex Track one must select the individual parts in section one wants to flex (must consist of more than one part), then double click the selection and hold down the left mouse button on the second click. If this is done successfully, the mouse icon will change from a brick to an arrow with Flex Track symbol.
While continuing to hold down the mouse button, the track can now be flexed within the parameters of the real Flex Track by moving the mouse in the desired direction of the flex. To stop flexing the track, simply release the left mouse button.</P>
