<P>The <B>Program Language</B> can be changed at the top left. The change will affect almost all the text occurrences in the program. You must restart BlueBrick for the changes to take effect.  Items which are not affected by the change are the tabs over the parts pane, and windows which are linked directly to the language of your OS (eg. color selection palette).</P>

<P>Setting your <B>Default Configurations</B> for new maps can save time at a later stage. One grid and brick layer are added as default. To change the entries for Author, LUG/LTC and Show in an existing map go to the <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;view &gt; general information...&nbsp;</FONT>.</P>

<P>The <B>Recent Files List</B> is set to 4 as default. 20 is the maximum. You can clear the list using the "Clear Recent File List" button at any time. Note that this action can not be undone.</P>

<P>There are several <B>Mouse Configurations</B>. The zoom centering feature is selected as default and enables you to zoom into the area to which your mouse cursor is pointing. De-activating the feature will zoom in and out of the center of the screen. The zoom speed can be changed by adjusting the wheel sensitivity. The higher the number, the faster the zoom.</P>

<P>The <B>Undo/Redo</B> lists can be adjusted. The maximum number of undo's recorded is 1000. The maximum number displayed is 50. Note that the larger the number of undo's recorded, the more memory the application will need.</P>

<P>The <B>Performance</B> settings might be important for older computers. The "balanced" setting is chosen as default. You may choose the "Less Memory" option if you notice that you system becomes unstable during use. Most computers should be able to run in the "balanced" or "faster" modes.</P>
