<H1>Window Panes</H1>

<H2>The Layout pane</H2>
<P>The layout pane is located on the left side of the screen and is recognizable by its standard blue background and white grid layout. This pane offers an adjustable "snap to" grid feature which will help you align the various elements of your track layout. For more details about the Layout pane, please read the <A HREF="Navigation.htm">Navigation</A> and the <A HREF="Creating_Modifying_Layouts.htm">Creating and Modifying Layouts</A> sections.</P>

<H2>The Parts pane</H2>
<P>The parts pane is located at the top right of the main window and consists of several category tabs that organize the available parts for you to build your layout. To build your layout, you will basically drag and drop Parts from the parts pane to the Layout pane. For more details about the Parts pane, please read the <A HREF="Part_Library.htm">Part Library</A> section.</P>

<H2>The Layer pane</H2>
<P>The Layer pane is located at the bottom right corner. This feature is especially useful for more complicated layouts. In this pane you can add, remove and organize the various layers that you need. Details can be found in the <A HREF="Creating_Using_Layers.htm">Creating and Using Layers</A> section.</P>
