<H1>Choosing a language</H1>
<P>The first thing you may wish to do is change the software language. In order to do this you go to <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;edit &gt; preferences... &gt; general&nbsp;</FONT> and chose the language you need from the drop down list in the top left corner and press "OK". If it is the first time you have chosen a language, BlueBrick will need to download the files from the internet. A new window for the Download Center will open. Press "Start Download" to download the language.

The installation will take place automatically and you will be asked to restart BlueBrick for the changes to take effect.</P>

<P>If this help file was translated in your language, next time you choose <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;help &gt; content and index&nbsp;</FONT>, the help will be displayed in the language chosen for the application.</P>
