<h1>Creating and Using Layers</h1>
<p>Layers add extra flexibility and make your layout easier to organize. Users of photo editing packages such as Photoshop will be familiar with this system. But in BlueBrick there are different types of Layers which handle different types of objects such as Texts, Rulers and of course Parts. This also means that you can only create those objects on a layer of their corresponding type.</p>
<p>This is why you should read in this section how to use the <a href="Creating_Using_Layers_Layer_Toolbar.htm">Layer Toolbar</a> and the difference between <a href="Creating_Using_Layers_Different_Type_of_Layers.htm">the five different types of layers</a> before starting to create your layout.</p>
