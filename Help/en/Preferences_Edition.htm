<P>There are several <B>Mouse Configurations</B>. The zoom centering feature is selected as default and enables you to zoom into the area to which your mouse cursor is pointing. De-activating the feature will zoom in and out of the center of the screen. The zoom speed can be changed by adjusting the wheel sensitivity. The higher the number, the faster the zoom.</P>
