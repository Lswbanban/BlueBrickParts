<P>Most of the parts should ignore this tag. If this tag is set with "true", the part will not be visible in the Part Library of the application. If the tag is missing or set to "false" then the part will appear as normal in BlueBrick's Part Library view. This tag is usefull if you want to create a group accessible in the part library, but you want to hide all the sub-parts of the group.</P>

<P>Even if this flag is set to true, BlueBrick will load the associated image (if any), and all the XML properties, as well as making the part fully functionnable  on the map (connection points, etc...).  With other words, if you have this hidden part in a group in your layout, then "ungroup" the group, you will be able to manipulate the part just like any other part. Setting the flag to true, only prevents the part from appearing in the library and being able to be dragged onto the map.</P>
