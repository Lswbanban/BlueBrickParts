<H1>Zooming and Viewing</H1>

<P>To make it simple, all the navigation operations are placed on the Wheel button of your mouse. The left button is reserved for the selection (see the <A HREF="Selecting_Parts.htm">Selecting Parts</A> section), and the right button is only for the context menus.</P>

<H2>Zooming</H2>
<P>Zooming can be done using the <FONT CLASS="Important">mouse wheel</FONT> or by holding down the SHIFT + RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON while moving the mouse up or down. You can configure the Zooming behavior (zooming speed, zoom center) in the <A HREF="General_Preferences.htm">General Preferences</A>.</P>

<H2>Paning the view</H2>
<P>The Viewing position can be changed by <FONT CLASS="Important">holding down the mouse wheel</FONT> over the Layout and moving the mouse as required. Alternatively you can hold the SHIFT + LEFT MOUSE BUTTON buttons down and move the mouse as required.</P>
