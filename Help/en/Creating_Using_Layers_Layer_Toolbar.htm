<h1>The Layer Toolbar</h1>

<h2>Selecting layers</h2>
<p>In the layer stack at the bottom right corner of BlueBrick, only one Layer can be selected at a time. The selected layer is displayed with a gray background <FONT CLASS="RefNumber">10</FONT>. To select another layer, simply click on it in the layer stack. The notion of selected layer is important because it is the active layer in which all your layout modifications will take place. Conveniently, when you move your mouse over the layout panel, the mouse cursor will change according to the type of the currently selected layer.</p>

<P>The Layer Toolbar at the bottom of the layer pane provides the basic layer controls:</P>

<h2>Reordering layers</h2>
<p>The layer stack is rendered as you may expect: the layers on top of the stack are covering the layers of the bottom. This allow you to place the LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> parts above the tables for example, as shown on the screenshot. But you can of course reorder the layer stack: moving layers to the front or back is done with buttons <font class="RefNumber">1</font> and <font class="RefNumber">2</font> respectively. It will move the contents of the layer tab <font class="RefNumber">10</font>, which you have selected.</p>

<h2>Adding layers</h2>
<p>Adding layers is done with buttons <font class="RefNumber">3</font> through <font class="RefNumber">7</font>. Their functions will be discussed in the <a href="Creating_Using_Layers_Different_Type_of_Layers.htm">five different type of layers</a> section. Note that each new layer you add, will be placed at the front. If you wish to have it below a previous layer you must use the "move layer down" button <font class="RefNumber">1</font>.</p>

<h2>Removing layers</h2>
<p>Removing layers can be done by selecting the layer tab and pressing button <font class="RefNumber">8</font>.</p>

<h2>Layer properties</h2>
<p>Layer properties can be changed by double clicking on the layers <font class="RefNumber">10</font> or through the <font class="path">&nbsp;Edit &gt; Current Layer Options...&nbsp;</font> menu. This includes changing the layer name and its transparency. Other properties differ depending on the layer type.</p>

<h2>Layer visibility</h2>
<p>Layer visibility can be changed by clicking on the eye icon <font class="RefNumber">9</font> of the layer you want to hide, or unhide. The visibility can also be changed in the layer properties.</p>
