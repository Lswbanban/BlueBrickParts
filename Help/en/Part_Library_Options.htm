<P>The <B>Tab Order</B> enables you to define in which order the parts folders/categories are placed above the part library window. This way you can sort them from left to right, from most used to least used. This can be done by selecting a category in the list and using the up or down buttons.  The list order from top to bottom represents left to right respectively above the parts library window.</P>
</P>

<P>The <B>Appearance</B> lets you change the background color of the library window.</P>

<P><B>Bubble Information</B> allows you to chose the information you will receive in the "tool tip" messages when you move the mouse over an icon in the parts library window. Note that in order to see the "tool tip" messages you must activate them by right clicking on the part library window and selecting "Bubble Information".</P>
