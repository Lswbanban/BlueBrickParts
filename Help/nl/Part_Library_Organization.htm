<H2>Organization</H2>
<P>The "Custom" tab provides some unofficial parts, or the parts you may create yourself by grouping some existing parts (see <A HREF="How_to_save_a_Group_in_the_Library.htm">How to save a group in the Library</A> section).</P>
<P>Please note that these tabs will always appear in English no matter which language is chosen for the software. This is because the titles reflect the names of the folders in which the parts are located. If you rename the subfolders in the BlueBrick parts folder, this change will be reflected in the tab titles (after reloading the Part library from <FONT CLASS="path">&nbsp;File &gt; Reload Part Library&nbsp;</FONT> or relaunching BlueBrick). It is safe to do it because BlueBrick does not use the folder names to reference the parts in your map.</P>

<H2>Various Display Preferences</H2>
<P>Right clicking the parts pane will bring a contextual Menu to choose some options:</P>

<P>the thumbnails smaller so you see more parts at any one time.</P>
