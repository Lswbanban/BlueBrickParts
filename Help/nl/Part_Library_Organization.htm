<H1>The Part Library Organization and Display Preferences</H1>

<h2>Tab Organization</h2>
<p>The Part Library is organized in tabs. Let op dat deze tabs altijd in het Engels worden weergegeven, ongeacht welke taal wordt gekozen voor de software. Dit komt omdat de titels van de tabbladen de namen van de mappen waarin de onderdelen staan weerspiegelen. Als je de submappen in de onderdelen map hernoemt, zal deze verandering tot uiting komen in de tabblad titels (after reloading the Part library from <span class="path">&nbsp;File &gt; Reload Part Library&nbsp;</span> or relaunching BlueBrick). It is safe to do it because BlueBrick does not use the folder names to reference the parts in your layout. However, it is not recommended especially if you want to <a href="Part_Library_Download_Additional_Parts.htm">update your Part Library</a> from internet, because in that case it will confuse BlueBrick when checking which library folder is already installed on your computer.</p>

<p>Some parts of the official library may also change of tab from one version of BlueBrick to another, due to reorganization done by the BlueBrick Part Manager (who is usually a member of the community of LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> Fans), which also doesn't affect the layouts created by the BlueBrick users.</P>

<P>The "Custom" tab provides some unofficial parts, or the parts you may create yourself by grouping some existing parts (see <A HREF="Part_Library_Save_a_Group_in_the_Library.htm">How to save a group in the Library</A> section). After saving your group in the "Custom" tab, you are, of course, free to move it to another tab, or even to a new tab you may create yourself. Some Parts in the Custom folder are also here for compatibility reasons with Track Designer.</P>

<p>Inside a tab, the parts are sorted first with there "sorting key" defined in the XML file of the part, and then with their name (see the <A HREF="Part_XML_Description_SortingKey.htm">Sorting Key</A> section for more details). The "sorting key" of the official parts are chosen by the Part Manager who usually uses categories to group the parts in a logical manner, like for example: Creator, City, Modular, etc...</p>

<p>The order in which the Tab are listed in the Library can also be customized in order to let you display the tabs you use the most at the beginning. To customize the tab order, please read the <A HREF="Preferences_Part_Library.htm">Part Library Preferences</A> section.</p>

<h2>Official Parts</h2>

<p>BlueBrick is welcoming in its Official Library, all the official LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> Set plus some individual parts that are useful for Layout planning like baseplates, road and train track. The Official Library can also host some widely spread custom modification among LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> Fans like for example half rail tracks. But the library does not intend to host all the individual LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> parts existing as the LDraw Library does. However the Official BlueBrick Library follows the LDraw naming convention to avoid any name clash.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the <A HREF="Creating_Modifying_Layouts_Grouping_Parts.htm">Grouping feature</a> in BlueBrick, Official Sets are often implemented as a Group which can be ungrouped once added on the layout. So if you just need a sub element of a Set on your layout, first search for the whole Set in the Library, then add it to your layout and ungroup it. Finally you can cherry pick the sub element you want and delete the rest.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the sub elements of an Official Set tries to follow the arrangement depicted on the picture of the box, but if you don't like it, you can ungroup the set and rearrange the elements (for example you can move the car of the set, far from the buildings).</p>

<p>Official Sets that have hinged bricks (like for example a house that can be open in two) are usually implemented with the <a href="Creating_Modifying_Layouts_Using_Flex_Track.htm">Flex feature</a>, so you can also adjust the opening position if you don't like the default one (as it can be seen with the Town Plan Set example beside).</p>

<h2>Various Display Preferences</h2>

<P>The appearance of each Part Library Tab can be tuned by right-clicking in it. It will bring a contextual Menu in which you can choose some options:</P>
<ul>
	<li><b>Large Icons:</b> you can choose to display the parts with large icons to see more clearly the details of the parts, or with small icons, to see more parts at once.</li>
	<li><b>Respect Proportion:</b> It is sometimes difficult to judge the size of a part compared to another. It is typically the case for the baseplates for which you want to spot immediately the large and small ones. So if you choose to respect the proportion, each part will keep its size proportional to the largest part in the Tab. However this may create very tiny thumbnails if a very large part is in the Tab, so this option is not suitable for the Town Tab for example. In that case, not choosing to Respect the Proportion will cause each thumbnail to use the maximum available space.</li>
	<li><b>Part Information:</b> If this option is enabled various information on the part will be displayed under the part icon. You can customize the information you want to display in the <a href="Preferences_Part_Library.htm">Part Library Preferences</a> section. Note that these information are also displayed in the Status Bar, even if this option is disabled.</li>
	<li><b>Bubble Information:</b> If this option is enabled a yellow bubble displaying various information on the part will popup when you move your mouse cursor over the part. You can customize the information you want to display in the <A HREF="Preferences_Part_Library.htm">Part Library Preferences</A> section. Note that these information are also displayed in the Status Bar, even if this option is disabled.</li>
</ul>
