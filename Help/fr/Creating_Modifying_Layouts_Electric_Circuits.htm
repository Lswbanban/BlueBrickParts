<p>The <b>Electric Circuits</b> option, which can be reach through the <span class="Path">&nbsp;View > Electric Circuit&nbsp;</span> menu, makes it possible to check for short circuits within a layout.</p>

<p>This feature is specifically aimed at users of 12 and 9 volt track. When using 12 or 9 volt track, any configuration that permits a train to reverse direction (such as a wye or reversing loop), will create a short circuit. When activated, this feature will mark the section of track which is causing the short circuit with an orange "Z".</p>

<p>Short circuits are no longer an issue when using RC and Power Function track as these do not have integrated powerlines.</p>
