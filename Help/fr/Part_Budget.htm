<h1>Part Budget</h1>

<p>BlueBrick can manage a limit number for each part in the Part Library. This set of maximum/limit numbers is called a Budget. The main goal of the Budget is to easily check if you will be able to build a layout designed with BlueBrick with your actual LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup> collection. If you decide to use a Budget, BlueBrick can simply warn you if your layout contains more parts of a certain type than what you actually have in your collection. It can even prevent you to exceed that limit when you design your layout.</p>

<p>For each part in the library, you can define a Budget Number (read the <a href="Part_Budget_Using_Budget.htm">Using a Budget</a> section for more details) and save the whole collection to a file. By using several files you can of course manage different collections, for example one file for your personnal collection and one file for the merged collection of your LUG/LTC used for collaborative projects. Read the <a href="Part_Budget_Saving_and_Loading_Budget.htm">Saving and Loading a Budget</a> section to learn more about how to manage budget files.</p>
